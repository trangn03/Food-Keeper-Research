# FoodKeeperResearch

The FoodKeeperResearch Project is a project which aims to use machine learning techniques to encourage humans to produce less overall wasted food. This techniques used are in the field of Natural Language Processing; specifically Named-Entity-Recognition and a less common method called the Snowball method. The two methods are combined with the goal of achieving the highest precision and recall on a custom test dataset.

This model was designed in both in both a GPU and CPU environment. Choose the one for your machine. The GPU model was a more recent installment with other code there as well following an unfinished approach.
