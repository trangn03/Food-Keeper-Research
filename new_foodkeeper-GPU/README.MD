# FoodKeeperResearch

The FoodKeeperResearch Project is a project which aims to use machine learning techniques to encourage humans to produce less overall wasted food. This techniques used are in the field of Natural Language Processing; specifically Named-Entity-Recognition and a less common method called the Snowball method. The two methods are combined with the goal of achieving the highest precision and recall on a custom test dataset.

This model was designed for training using the computer's GPU, the other folder is designed alongside to run with a CPU if a GPU is not accesible or desired for the model.
