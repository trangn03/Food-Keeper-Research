# FoodKeeperResearch

The FoodKeeperResearch Project is a project which aims to use machine learning techniques to encourage humans to produce less overall wasted food. This techniques used are in the field of Natural Language Processing; specifically Named-Entity-Recognition and a less common method called the Snowball method. The two methods are combined with the goal of achieving the highest precision and recall on a custom test dataset.



## How to Use
To run open the notebok and run the cell under the 'Function Declarations' header. This cell initializes all the necessary functions


Next run the cell under the 'Find the most common words' header. This cell finds the most common verbs in the collection of Tweets and can be used while training as a requirement.

Finally run the cell under 'Training Loop' to begin the training process.
